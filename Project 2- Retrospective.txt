    What feature/aspect of your project are you most proud of?
    Im most proud of the login and register section. I had some weird bugs implementing the login portion so it was nice to see it finally working.

    What are some challenges you faced while working on the project?
    Communicating with the team efficiently was a major challenge in the beginning as we didn't set up a good system.  However, we were able to get things going a bit into the project.

    What would you work on if you had another week on project 2?
    If I had another week to work on project 2 then I would mainly fix the features that weren't working such as the checkout and the AWS.

    What would you do differently if you could start the project over?
    Start quickly and commmunicate with the team more efficiently.  Took a bit to get things going smoothly. In particular the github repository system we were using was a mess at first.

    What do you wish you knew at the start of the project (either about the development process or the technologies used)?
    More about how to use the git flow and branches properly, we had some strange issues pulling and cloning the repositories.

    How can you apply these lessons to project 3?
    In project 3 I can use the lessons I learned from the second project in order to increase productivity as well as get things planned out much quicker and more efficiently.
